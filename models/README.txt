This archive contains two leadfield models kindly contributed 
by the CERL laboratory of IMT-Atlantique, led by prof. F.P. Andriulli.

These models can be used in the simBCI simulation framework.

leadfield-sphere.mat : 

    A simple spherical leadfield model. This model has 1145 source dipoles and 256 electrodes. 
	Each source has 3 degrees of freedom.

leadfield-mediumRefinement.mat :

   A realistic head model derived from an MRI volume. This model has 9417 source dipoles and 258 electrodes. 
   The sources are constrained by the cortical surface normal and hence have 1 degree of freedom per each.
