Branch naming
=============

Branch names should have the following structure:
    - 'prefix'-'author_name'-'description'

Where 'prefix' can be:

#. experiment : experimental branch related to a paper/publication, test or hacking.
#. feature : clean version of something to be merged to master.
#. paper : branch representing the state of the code used for a publication. Should not evolve after the paper has been published.
